# YaBoi Version 2

## README

This is just a dump of the whole bot. I did not post it here like a plug and play. If you can find the issues present and fix it you can use it. Remember that I did not post this here so people can bot Twitch. This has been made for educational purposes only. UNKWN services's bot is now public.

## YaBoi version 2 is a repack ( rewrite ) of YaBoi VPS

### Voice recognition and mention recognition

The first bot that spawns will be called the "handler" and it will notify all other bots of any mentions or voice recognitions that happen.
The bots will communicate over sockets instead of file reads and writes.
The bots will have a specific thread open just for that purpose

## Source.py

    - Starts the bots
    - Check if bots died
    - Restart bots of they died
    - Updates the server on when a bot is spawned.

## Active bots file needs to be made differently

## Test if you can lower the price of VPSs used now that the bots don't use as much CPU and RAM




## Changes required on the server:

Config file changes need to be met

Enable requests

Go back to 2 hour start


## TO DO

Auto detect when a stream starts or shuts down

Slow bot exits

Different bot accounts for legit and for money making

Complete list for voice and mention recogniton to be able to be downloaded 
from the website.

Detect repies too, not only mentions

Automatic website payment processing.

Fix bots sending the same message ( general chat must be sliced too or messages must be super generic )

Bots do not respond to most of the voice recognition prompts...
